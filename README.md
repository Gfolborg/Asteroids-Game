# Asteroids Game (Python + Pygame)

This is a simple version of the classic *Asteroids* game, built using **Python** and **Pygame**.

The project was part of a **guided course** on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev), where I was given high-level instructions and goals — but I had to write all the game logic and code myself. It challenged me to think critically about object movement, collision detection, and game flow.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pygame** (game loop, events, rendering)
- **Python Virtual Environment (venv)**
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

### What I Learned:
- Setting up and managing a virtual environment
- Creating a game loop and handling player input
- Using object-oriented programming to manage ships, asteroids, and bullets
- Detecting collisions and updating game state in real-time
- Debugging logic and rendering issues with print statements and iteration
- Using GitHub to publish, track, and document my code

### In Progress:
This project is still under development — I plan to add more features like:
- Score tracking
- Multiple lives
- Game over and restart screens
- Sound effects and background music
- Difficulty scaling

This project gave me real experience writing and debugging logic-heavy code. It taught me how to break down complex tasks into smaller components and build a functional, playable game from scratch — even with limited guidance.

*Run it locally to try it out — destroy asteroids and avoid getting hit
