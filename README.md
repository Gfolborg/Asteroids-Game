# Asteroids Game (Python + Pygame)

This is a mini-project where I built a simple version of the classic *Asteroids* game using Python and the Pygame library.

The project was completed as part of a course on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev), where I followed step-by-step instructions and added my own touches along the way. It helped me understand how to structure a Python game from the ground up using real development tools.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pygame**
- **Python Virtual Environment (venv)**
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

### What I Learned:
- Using virtual environments for Python projects
- Setting up a game loop and handling user input
- Working with sprites, events, and collisions
- Managing project files with Git and GitHub
- Understanding how larger projects are broken into smaller, testable pieces

While this was a guided project, I wrote all the code myself and used the experience to deepen my understanding of Python, Pygame, and project structure. I'm continuing to build more independent projects as I grow.
